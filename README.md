The cryptosystem devised by Boneh, Goh, and Nissim  was the first to allow both additions and multiplications with a constant-size ciphertext. There is a catch, however: while the additive property is the same as for the ElGamal variant, only one multiplication is permitted. The system is thus called “somewhat homomorphic.”
